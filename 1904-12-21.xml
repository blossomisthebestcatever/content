                        SXELLDES. Prloo Ono Plastro Terits. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1904. THE PORT
                        ARTHUR STRUGGLE. Threatened men live long, they say, and Port Arthur, which
                        was to fall months ago, still gallantly holds out, though signs are not
                        wanting that the end is not far off. General Stoessel and his garrison can
                        at least congratu| late themselves that they have made a gallant defence and
                        done their couutry an invaluable service. The one bright spot in the war so
                        far as Russia is concerned hitherto has been the defence of Port Arthur.
                        Reuter's telegrams during the past two or three days describing the fierce
                        fighting for the forts to the east of Port Arthur form one of the most
                        terrible bits of reading that the war has provid. ed. The scene of the
                        conflict after it was over must have been even more trightful than the scene
                        about 203-Mètre Hill. We learn to-day that 26 Japanese officers were killed
                        and 44 wounded during the attacks. The net result has been the advance of
                        the Japanese and the capture of the north fort east of Kik-wan, along with
                        five Russian field guns and two Maxims. The Russian fleet at Port Arthur has
                        been reduced to six destroyers. The question now occurs, Will the Japs
                        resume the struggle here, and make one last supreme effort to take Port
                        Arthur by storm? Or will they be content, as seems to be thought likely in
                        Tokio now, with battering the remnants of the Russian fleet to uselessness
                        from the west, and leave the place to be starved out, as, according to | all
                        appearances, it may be even before the Baltic Fleet could arrive? The
                        Japanese keep their own counsel, and we need not attach much importance to
                        predictions and hints. Just before the 203-Mètre Hill attack, the prophecy
                        that steady besieging would replace the policy of assault had been more
                        pronounced than ever. </p>

                    <head>THE BALTIO FLEET.</head>
                    <p>Our Port Said Correspondent to-day states that it is reported there that the
                        ships of the second Baltic Fleet are now concentrated at Ceuta Bay, but
                        there is no indication of their proceeding further at present. The rumour
                        that the Baltic Fleet is to return to Russia after sufficient interval would
                        seem to have every appearance of plausibility. To recall the tleet will no
                        doubt require some moral courge to send it on would require no courage at
                        all (at St. Petersburg), but merely a desperation and an obstiuate refusal
                        to face the facts, bordering on insanity. Indeed, some recent acts on the
                        partof the Russian Admiralty have disposedone to wonder whether the
                        hereditary madness of the Romanoff's is not finding a disastrous outlet in
                        the international activities of the Grand Dukes. There may be reasons of
                        military poneys why Port Arthur should not capitulate : there can be none
                        for sending on Rojdestverskys crazy squadron like sheep to the slaughter. It
                        is poor policy for and depleted exchequer to throw bad ships after good. If
                        we were | a vindictive nation we could have hoped for Lo more tidedus a
                        revenge than the fingering torture of the long voyage, with the prospect of
                        all but mevitable douin at the end of it. The men have not even the chance
                        of dying gloriously, as the Port Arthurgarrison 18 dying. They are
                        dishonoured in advance. Come wuat may, history can never write down as
                        heroes the crews who went mad with fright at the sight of a few English
                        trawlers, </p>

                        off Korea. She was bound for Vladivostok. It is supposed that she was

                        Russian destroyers who escaped from Shanghai. A Japanese guardship has
                        captured the British steamer "King Arthur” bound from Bombay. She was

                        obliged to take a circuitous route via Laraiche, owing to the fact that the
                        tribesmen were plotting to waylay him. The Sultan has dismissed all
                        Europeans from his service, and is reverting to the old ways in order to
                        ingratiate himself with the people. (Reuter)</p>

                            January under exalted patronage, in aid of the ever-needy S. P. C. A.
                            and various military charities, are proceeding apace. The cast is now

                            capable hands, and under the stage management of Major Delavoye the
                            piece, from a theatrical point of view, gives every promise of being

                            higher standard than is usual with amateurs. He has, moreover, found
                            good material to work pon. The men's choruses are especially efficient,
                            and the pirates' and policeman's numbers will undoubtedly be counted
                            among the 'hits' of the piece. </p>

                            Orowetz and C. G. Massiah, and were both encored. Mr. A. Otto, 'cellist,
                            and Mr. Eisler, violinist, were at their best in Saint Saën's Danse

                            Trovatore was sung by Messrs. A. Orowetz (soprano falsetto), Massiah
                            (tenor), and the chorus of the club, under the direction of Mr. Bussa.
